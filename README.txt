WHERE TO START
--------------
This is a theme for themers and includes the building blocks for your HTML5 theme. 
This theme is designed to be a starter theme which you copy/paste and begin developing on.


INSTALLATION
------------

 1. Download jBase5 from http://drupal.org/project/jbase5

 2. Unpack the downloaded file, take the folders and place them in your
    Drupal installation under one of the following locations:
      sites/all/themes
        making it available to the default Drupal site and to all Drupal sites
        in a multi-site configuration
      sites/default/themes
        making it available to only the default Drupal site
      sites/example.com/themes
        making it available to only the example.com site if there is a
        sites/example.com/settings.php configuration file

    Note: you will need to create the "themes" folder under "sites/all/"
    or "sites/default/".

 3. Make a copy of the "jbase5" directory and paste it in the same root directory.

 4. Rename "jbase5" to your desired theme name.

 5. Open your newly copied/created directory and rename "jbase5.info" and it's references of
    "jbase5" to your theme's name. Do the same for all references in the theme's "template.php"
    and "theme-settings.php" file.

 6. Go to your site and enable your newly copied/created theme and begin developing!
